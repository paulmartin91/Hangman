<h1>Hangman</h1>
<p>A simple game of hangman I made using CSS flexboxes
<br>
<sub><i>Coded from scratch by Paul Martin using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of JQuery too.</i></sub>
</p>
<h2>A few notes...</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Add words!</b> - The 'rawPhrases' array is designed to take new phrases and add them to the game, I made a few to start off with, but feel free to cahnge them or add more</li>
<li><b>Special Characters</b> - The final puzzle includes special characters</li>
<li><b>How to play</b> - Click letters to reveal letters within the hidden word(s), guess one wrong and it will add another element to the hangman. Guess all the right letters and move onto the next word, complete the hangman and you loose</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>So please enjoy and let me know what you think, or if you come across any bugs!</p>
